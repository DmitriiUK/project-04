            <p>Whether you own a motorcycle, or you don’t, you’ve probably met someone in your life that liked and cared about his/her motorcycle. You’ve probably met a rider who liked his/her motorcycle so much, that he/she attributed his/her bike some human aspects. Some riders even talk to their motorcycles, as if they had souls.</p>
            <p>Motorcycle riders aren’t the only ones in love with their vehicles, but it seems to be much more common with motorcyclists, than with car drivers. Most bike riders would say that they often feel closer and more personal to their beloved motorcycles than do car owners to their vehicles.</p>
            <p>It gets better. Some people say that riding a bike is an intimate experience. “Because they have an individual personality. Almost all cars drive pretty much the same. Not so with motorcycles. They become a part of who you are”, a fellow rider once said.</p>
